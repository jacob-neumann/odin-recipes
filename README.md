Project 1: Recipes - The Odin Project - Foundations
Completed: 15 June 2022

This is the first full project that I am doing as a part of The Odin Project's
Foundations path. In this project, I will be creating a simple website with a 
main index page and a handful of recipes. 

The skills to be demonstrated to this point are basic html (creating pages,
using \<strong>, \<em>, \<img>, and links) and simple usage of git. I have not 
learned CSS yet, so it is rather minimalist.

After learning CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript, I may create a new version
of this project to showcase the difference in what I have learned. However,
as my focus is primarily on learning web development to create accessible
tools to be run in browsers for work and personal projects, it will be 
low on my priority list.

information on this project.
