Project 1: Recipes - The Odin Project - Foundations

This is the first full project that I am doing as a part of The Odin Project's
Foundations path. In this project, I will be creating a simple website with a 
main index page and a handful of recipes. 

The skills to be demonstrated to this point are basic html (creating pages,
using <strong>, <em>, <img>, and links) and simple usage of git. I have not 
learned CSS yet, so it is rather minimalist.

See https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes for  more 
information on this project.
