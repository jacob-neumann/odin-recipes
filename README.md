Project 1: Recipes - The Odin Project - Foundations
Initial Framework Completed: 15 June 2022
CSS Update Completed: 16 June 2022

This is the first full project that I am doing as a part of The Odin 
Project's Foundations path. In this project, I created a simple 
website with a main index page and a handful of recipes. 

The skills to be demonstrated to this point are basic html (creating 
pages, using \<strong>, \<em>, \<img>, and links) and simple usage
of git. 

See https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes for
more information on this project.

Update 1 - 16 June 2022 : Added some basic CSS (background, text 
alignment, and a box around the notes section for each website)
