 <h3> Recipes</h3> 
 <p> I have added three recipes that I commonly use in my own cooking or meal preparation to this site as a way to practice basic html and 
    website organization. I hope you find them useful!
 </p>  
 <ul class="recipe-list">
    <li><a href="./recipes/pasta-sauce.html">Tomato Pasta Sauce</a></li>
    <li><a href="./recipes/weeknight-tacos.html">Weeknight Tacos</a></li>
    <li><a href="./recipes/easy-veggies.html">Easy Mixed Vegetables</a></li>
 </ul>

<h3> Background</h3>
<p> This site is a project done as a part of The Odin Project's Foundations course, allowing me to practice with html and git basics.
    My ultimate goal is to use web design to create <em>web-accessible</em> tools for work and personal use. Web applications are ideally suited
    for many of my use cases, as it is difficult to get permission to write and execute code on my work computers. While this project does not involve 
    programming, it is necessary to learn how to make web applications usable (I don't plan on running a command line within a browser to 
    interface with my backend software).
