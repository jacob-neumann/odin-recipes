        <h2> Quick and Easy!</h2>
        <p> Tacos are a comfort food of mine. They are so flexible, and can be served with such a wide array of fixings! While making tacos al pastor, pollo asada, or carnitas might take too long for a weeknight dinner, there is an easier alternative. This recipe is one I use very often for a quick and easy dinner and meal prep! What takes this recipe from boring to spectacular is using homemade taco seasoning. I use modified version of <a href:="https://www.seriouseats.com/taco-seasoning-recipe"> this recipe</a> <sup>1</sup> from Serious Eats and some habanero chilli powder to bump it up a notch. This recipe makes <strong>3-4 servings,</strong>and can be easily scaled up as required.</p>

        <p> I don't always have a lot of time or energy after work, so I appreciate that this recipe is fast! It only takes me about <strong>20 minutes of prep</strong> before it is ready to serve, including making the taco seasoning from scratch! Even better, it doesn't generate a lot of dirty dishes. Now let's get to it!</p>
    
        
    
        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1lb ground beef <sup>2</sup></li>
            <li> 1 can (15oz) kidney beans<sup>3</sup></li>
            <li> 1 can (15oz) black beans<sup>3</sup></li>
            <li> 1 batch of <a href:="https://www.seriouseats.com/taco-seasoning-recipe">Serious Eats Taco Seasoning</a> (modified) or 1 bag of pre-made mix<sup>1,4</sup> </li>
            <li> 1-2 tbsp lime juice <em>(optional)<sup>5</sup></em></li>
            <li> Tortilla Chips or Tortillas to serve with the filling</li>
            <li> Any desired toppings (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.)</li>

            
        </ul>
    
        <h3> Necessary Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 large skillet or frying pan</li>
            <li> 1 spatula to stir
            <li> Small bowl to mix taco seasoning</li>
            <li> Measuring spoons to make taco seasoning</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Make taco seasoning<sup>4</sup> using <a href:="https://www.seriouseats.com/taco-seasoning-recipe">this Serious Eats recipe</a> with the modifications in note 1 (if desired)</li>
            <li> In a large skillet over medium heat, brown beef and break into small chunks with the spatula</li>
            <li> While cooking the meat, open the cans of beans (don't dump out the liquid!)</li>
            <li> Once the beef is cooked, add both cans of beans, taco seasoning, and lime juice. Stir until combined and allow to come to a boil</li>
            <li> Reduce heat to low and stir as needed. Allow liquid to thicken until it reaches your desired consistency</li>
            <li> Remove from heat and serve with tortilla chips or tortillas and desired toppings</li>
        </ol>
    
    
        <h3> Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> I make a couple of minor modifications to the Serious Eats taco seasoning. I double the cumin and garlic powder, and replace a third of the chilli powder with habanero chilli powder from Savory Spice&#174 <a href="https://www.savoryspiceshop.com/products/habanero-chile-powder"></a></li>
            <li> I use 88% lean ground beef from Costco. I would avoid using beef with too much more fat so as to prevent significant splatter when cooking. </li>
            <li> Pinto beans are also good! Feel free to use only your favorite bean rather than having two different types as I do.</li>
            <li> Using pre-made taco seasoning is fine in a pinch.</li>
            <li> The lime juice is strictly optional. In fact, I didn't start adding it until recently. The acid from the lime juice does add some delicious contrast and flair to the tacos, but it works fine without it.</li>
        </ol>
