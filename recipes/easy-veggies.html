        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 bag frozen carrots<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li> 1 bag frozen green bans<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li> 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil <sup>2</sup></li>
            <li> Salt and Pepper (to taste)<sup>4</sup></li>
            
        </ul>
    
        <h3> Necessary Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 medium mixing bowl</li>           
            <li> 1 mixing spoon</li> 
            <li> 1 measuring spoon set</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Following the directions on the bags, cook each bag of frozen vegetables separately in the microwave, dumping the contents into the mixing bowl when they are done cooking.</li>
            <li> Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper to the veggies, mixing until the veggies are evenly coated</li>
            <li> Serve while hot!</li>
        </ol>
    
    
        <h3> Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Feel free to use other veggies, like brocoli and cauliflower</li>
            <li> You can always add more olive oil! I find that 1 tbsp is just enough to coat everything and help the seasonings adhere </li>
            <li> Other seasonings can work too, and can help the veggies pair better with your main course. For instance, adding some Italian seasoning might make it match better with Pasta! I like the simplicity of the salt and pepper though--it highlights the flavors of the veggies.</li>
