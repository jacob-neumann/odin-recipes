        <h2> Simple and Delicious! </h2>
        <p> Pasta sauce can be a complicated affair but it doesn't always need to be. I used this recipe in college and still use it to this day. This recipe relies on canned tomato sauce as a base, and uses meat and seasonings to take it from basic to delicious! It makes a big batch <strong>(20-24 servings)</strong> and freezes well, making it well suited for meal prep efforts. I typically split the sauce into 4 quart-size bags to freeze, with each bag containing enough sauce for between 4 and 6 servings of pasta (1 - 1.5 lbs of dry pasta)
        </p>
    
        <p> This recipe is relatively quick, requiring about <strong>20 minutes  of active prep time </strong> and periodic stirring during its simmering phase. I usually let it simmer for <strong> 1-2 hours</strong> to let all the flavors get to blend, but it is all up to personal taste.  </p>
    
        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 7 cans (15oz) of tomato sauce</li>
            <li> 1 can (6oz) of tomato paste</li>
            <li> 1lb ground beef</li>
            <li> 1lb ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li> 1 large yellow onion <em>(optional)<sup>1</sup></em></li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic <em>(optional)<sup>2</sup></em></li>
            <li> 2 tbsp <a href="https://savoryspiceshop.com/products/pizza-pasta-sprinkle">Savory Spice&#174 Pizza and Pasta Sprinkle</a> <em>(optional)<sup>3</sup></em></li>
            <li> 2 tbsp dry Oregano </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp dry basil</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3> Necessary Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 large pot and lid </li>
            <li> 1 cutting board</li>
            <li> 1 large knife</li>
            <li> 1 mortar and pestle to crush spices <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li> 1 stirring spoon</li> 
            <li> 1 measuring set for spices <em> (optional) <sup>4</sup></em></li>
            <li> 1 spoon or butter knife (to get the tomato paste out of the can</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Finely dice the onion (shoot for 1/4" to 1/8" pieces).</li>
            <li> Crush or mince the the garlic.</li>
            <li> In a large pot, begin cooking ground beef and sausage over medium-high heat, stirring as required. Don't be afraid to let a little fond (brown stuff on the bottom of the pan) develop--that is important flavor! </li>
            <li> After some of the fat from the meat has rendered, add the chopped onions and allow them to cook with the sausage. Continue to stir to avoid burning and to evenly cook the meat.</li>
            <li> While meat is cooking, open the cans of tomato sauce and paste.</li>
            <li> Once meat is cooked and onions are translucent, add the tomato sauce and tomato paste, stirring until combined.</li>
            <li> Grind the seasonings in a mortar and pestle until partially powdered and fragrant</li>
            <li> Add ground seasonings to the pasta sauce and stir to combine</li>
            <li> Once the sauce starts to boil, turn heat to low and cover with a lid. Stir periodically (every 10-20 minutes)</li>
            <li>Taste sauce after an hour, adding more seasonings to taste. Continue to let it simmer until it reaches your desired consistency and flavor. This can be anywhere from 1-3 hours</li>  
            <li>Serve immediately! Leftovers freeze rather well, and will also last for about a week in the refrigerator</li>
        </ol>
    
    
        <h3> Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> An onion will add a lot of flavor, but can easily be substituted with onion powder, dehydrated onion flakes, or both. You can even use onion powder in addition to an onion!</li>
            <li> Fresh garlic is ideal, but can be substituted with garlic powder</li>
            <li> The Savory Spice&#174 Pizza and Pasta Sprinkle which can be bought <a href="https://savoryspiceshop.com/products/pizza-pasta-sprinkle">online</a></li> is a really handy seasoning "framework" for pasta sauce, and contains basil, thyme, and oregano it well balanced portions. I use it to save <em>thyme</em> (do you get my terrible joke?), but you can use basil, thyme, and oregano in their unmixed forms and season to taste. Season to taste!
            <li> I'm gonna be honest... I don't really measure my seasonings for pasta sauce. I "eyeball" it, taste the sauce, and adjust accordingly. All the measurements of spices are rough estimates anyway.</li>
